# What is this?
This is all of my enteries for [Advant of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) a yearly event where each day 2 small programming puzzles are released.

# Contributions
Feel free to use and look at this code. However I won't be accepting pull requests because the idea of AOC is you do it yourself.

# License
All code here is released under MIT.
